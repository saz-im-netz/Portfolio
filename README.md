# Portfolio

## Description

This Project is my Portfolio Page to showcase some of my projects, that I am really proud of. I used the "Dopefolio" as a template and modified it to match my preferences. The site is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript and was deployed with Netlify. [live link](https://saz-portfolio-page.netlify.app/)

Thank you Ram Maheshwari for providing this template.
